# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text GUI using Python

This Python project provides a simple and interactive GUI-based application for converting text to speech and speech to text using gTTS and SpeechRecognition libraries. Built with Tkinter, this tool helps users interact with audio and text in a user-friendly environment.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Text to Speech (TTS) functionality using Google Text-to-Speech  
- ✅ Speech to Text (STT) conversion using Google Speech Recognition  
- ✅ Clean and responsive GUI made with Tkinter  
- ✅ Real-time input/output and audio playback  

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install gTTS SpeechRecognition pyaudio
```

⚠️ If you face issues installing pyaudio, use a .whl file based on your Python version from:  
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.  
2. Ensure your microphone is connected and working.  
3. Run the script:

```
python app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

**Text to Speech:**  
- Enter any text in the input field.  
- Click the "Text to Speech" button.  
- The app converts it to speech and plays the audio using the gTTS library.  

**Speech to Text:**  
- Click the "Speech to Text" button.  
- Speak into your microphone.  
- The recognized text will appear below the button using SpeechRecognition.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
